The Exploratory Data Analysis was carried out using R and visualized as different graphs and histograms.
The airline data is then
1.Normalized
2.Fed into a neural network
3.Input is AirTime and elapsed time
4.Output is Arrival and Departure delay
5.This training data is learned and tested with sample datas

The dimensions of the neural network is
3 x 4 layer 1
4 x 8 layer 2
8 x 32 layer 3
32 x 16 layer 4
16 x 4 layer 5
4 x 2 layer 6
